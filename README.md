# rsiv
This is the **alpha** version of the software and many features are still missing.

# usage
In order to run the image viewer, simply run ./rsiv /path/to/image.


Running the software without the image parameter is not yet supported.


In order to compile under GNU/Linux, in Build/Makefile, replace gcc48 with gcc. This will be changed in the near future.
